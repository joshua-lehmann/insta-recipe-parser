Instagram Recipe ParserThis project provides a complete Python solution to parse your saved Instagram collections, extract food-related posts, use local LLMs to structure them as recipes, and generate a static website to host and compare the results.FeaturesMulti-LLM Comparison: Specify multiple Ollama models in the config and the script will process each recipe with every model.Performance Benchmarking: Automatically times each LLM request and displays the average processing speed on the main page.Tabbed Recipe Views: Each recipe page features a tabbed interface, allowing for a direct, side-by-side comparison of the output quality from each model.Intelligent Caption Scraping: Uses Selenium to automate a web browser, successfully bypassing cookie and login popups for reliable caption fetching.Structured LLM Output: Leverages Pydantic and the ollama library to enforce a strict JSON schema, ensuring clean and predictable recipe data from the LLM.Automated Progress Saving: Creates a processing_progress.json file to track fetched captions and all model-specific recipe results. If the script is stopped, it resumes where it left off.Static Site Generation: Creates a clean, searchable, and responsive website in the docs/ folder, ready for hosting on GitHub Pages.Setup and Installation1. Install PythonEnsure you have Python 3.11 or newer installed.2. Install DependenciesIt's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate
# Or on Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Local LLMs with Ollamaa. Install Ollama:Go to ollama.com and install the application for your OS.b. Download Models:You can download multiple models to compare. Open your terminal and pull the desired models. llama3 is a great baseline, and phi3:mini is a good choice for a faster, smaller model.ollama pull llama3
ollama pull phi3:mini
ollama pull deepseek-coder:1.3b
How to Use the ScriptPlace Your Instagram Data:Place your saved_collections.json file in the root directory.Configure the Script:Open config.py.Set COLLECTION_NAME to the exact name of your food collection.Modify the LLM_MODELS list to include the names of the models you downloaded with Ollama and want to compare.Run the Main Script:Execute main.py from your terminal:python main.py
Check the Output:The docs/ folder will be created, containing the generated HTML files. Open docs/index.html in your browser to see the results.processing_progress.json: This file will be updated in real-time with the outputs from all models.failed.log: Any posts that could not be processed will be logged here.
